# Scores-Student-Poetry-Trees
An interactive Web-App Showcase of Student Poems
![](SCORES-Poetry-Tree_concept.png)
## Creative Goals
- We are looking for cool visualizations of our Students' poems to reward their expressions and inspire others.
- Connecting People
- A *Safe* and *Brave* Space to share and express
- Breaking down barriers in a segmented/separated world and softening the edges around the world

### Examples
- Sentiment and Emotion as Colors
- Growing, organic, animated (e.g. Particle Systems)
- Geographic/Spatial (where was this created? Where has it been heard/seen?)
- 3D, Orthographic, top-down?
- Interactive? If the atomic unit is a poem, how do we see and discover it?
- Changes over time... how can we represent this?
- Ambient information: What kind of context can be visualized?
- Feedback loops: Can some people contribute to the tagging, scoring, and interpretation of poems?
- Projected on the side of a building: Can this be a public, interactive, artpiece?
